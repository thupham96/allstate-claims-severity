# Allstate Claims Severity
## by Thu Pham


## Dataset

>  Allstate is developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this project, I will demonstrate insight into ways to predict claims severity using 4 different regression modeling methods: inear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net.


## Important Findings

- Among 4 regressions, Lasso performs the best with the score of 1270.24275. Linear Regression with all features selected performs the worst with the score of 1270.83899. Ridge is ranked second with the score of 1270.43005, and ElasticNet is ranked third with the score 1270.76490.
